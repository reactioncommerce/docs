## At a Glance

Now that you've added your customizations, made your front-end look and perform great, what's next. Well it's time 
to deploy your site to the cloud. This guide walks you through the process of deploying your site using [Kubernetes]
(https://kubernetes.io/) Google's technology for orchestrating Docker containers at scale.

## What you need

**Prerequisites**

As this document is focused upon deploying MailChimp Open Commerce, using Helm, some working knowledge of your chosen cloud provider and Kubernetes is required. For example, you will need a cloud hosted Kubernetes environment, and relevant administration/deployment permissions to said environment, before being able to proceed with the below. You will also need **kubectl** installed and configured to proceed.

This documentation has been written for and tested on Linux specifically, but all the included tools and components are also available for other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Please consult each components/tools bespoke documentation for guidance regarding non-Linux installation and configuration.

**Components**

Cloud Provider: Cloud vendors offer a multitude of third-party hosting services and solutions, including compute, networking, and storage. As mentioned, an account with a chosen cloud provider is required, with sufficient access privileges, to follow along with this guide.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/): Kubernetes, also known as K8s,
is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You will require an active cloud hosted Kubernetes environment before being able to proceed with the following.

[Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

[Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/):
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. Although utilising Ingress is optional, for the purposes of this document we shall assume that an Ingress Controller is deployed to the target Kubernetes environment and shall be utilising its services.

[Helm](http://Helm): Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications
-- Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. To deploy packaged Kubernetes manifests using Helm you will require administration/deployment privileges to your chosen Kubernetes environment.

## Configure and Test Authentication to Kubernetes Cluster

Prior to deploying a Helm chart, you must ensure that you have authentication configured to the target Kubernetes 
cluster. Authentication configuration can be dependent upon your chosen cloud provider, but it typically involves the setup of your local \~/.kube/config file with relevant [**credentials**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/) to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. Consult your cloud provider documentation for further information.

Authentication can be confirmed using a simple command such as the following.

```sh
kubectl get pods -A
```

If a list of pods is returned, then you are successfully authenticated and connected to your Kubernetes environment.

## Install Helm

We need to install **Helm** which, as mentioned above, works as the Kubernetes package framework for our Open Commerce deployment.

1.  The simplest method of installing Helm upon Linux is via a provided [**installation script**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script). A benefit of using the install script is that it should work across the most popular Linux distro's and is not tied to a particular package manager such as **apt** or **dnf**.

2.  Simply run the following commands to perform the Helm install.

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh
    ```

3.  The helm installation can be verified by running "helm version".

    ```sh
    helm version
    ```

## Clone Open Commerce Helm Chart

Next, we need to clone the Open Commerce Helm chart locally prior to deployment.

1.  Begin by creating a new local directory and then cloning the Helm chart repository.

    ```sh
    mkdir helm
    cd helm
    git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/mailchimp-open-commerce-helm-chart
    ```

## Prepare Values File

Now that we have the Helm chart available locally the next step is to prepare a values yaml file that contains all the necessary configuration for your deployment. Although the provided **values.yaml** file contains sensible defaults it will still require changes that are specific to your deployment and cloud infrastructure.

1. Begin by creating a copy of the provided values.yaml file.

    ```sh
    cd mailchimp-open-commerce-helm-chart/ && cp ./values.yaml ./my_values.yaml
    ```

2. Open the **my_values.yaml** file in your editor of choice 

3. Begin by editing the values under **global**.

    If using Stripe or Segment, then set their API keys as required.
    ```yaml
    stripeKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_STRIPE_API_KEY
    segmentKey: YOUR_PRIMATE_SEGMENT_API_KEY
    ```

    Ensure that **tokenSecret** is changed to a unique and secure value
    from the placeholder.

    ```yaml
    tokenSecret: ThisIsAnUnsecurePlaceHolder!Changeme!
    ```

4. Update the values under **admin** as required.

    ```yaml
    ## Admin Panel configuration
    admin:
    ```

    Of particular importance here is that the **host** value is set as
    the FQDN you wish to use for accessing the Open Commerce
    Administration portal.

    ```yaml
    host: admin.example.shop
    ```     

    Other values such as **replicaCount** can be amended as you see
    fit.

5. Next update the values under the **api** sub-section.
    ```yaml
    ##
    ## API configuration
    api:
    ```
   
    Again, of particular importance here is the **host** value, ensure it is set to the FQDN you wish to use for accessing the Open Commerce API endpoint.
    
   ```yaml
    host: admin.example.shop
    ```   

    You may also wish to uncomment and set the **enableGraphQlPlayground** to true if you wish to explore the API via the GraphQL Playground (recommended for Dev deployments). 
    
   ```yaml
   ##
   ## Serve the GraphQL Playground UI from /graphql
   enableGraphQLPlayground: true
   ```

6. Next move on to the **web** subsection. Which you may wish to disable completely if you only require a headless deployment of Open Commerce.
    ```yaml
   ##
   ## Example storefront configuration
   web: 
    ```

    The example storefront can be disabled via simply setting **enabled** to false. We shall leave as true for the sake of this deployment.

    Once again, of particular importance here is the **host** value, ensure it is set to the FQDN you wish to use for accessing the Open Commerce example storefront.

   ```yaml
    host: example.shop
    ```  

    Ensure that the **sessionSecret** is updated to a unique and secure value from its placeholder value.
    ```yaml
   sessionSecret: PlaceHolder!ChangeMe!
    ```

7. Finally move on to the **mongoDB** subsection.

    ```yaml
    ##
    ##
   mongodb:
    ```
    If you wish to utilise a separate MongoDB instance (such as one provided via [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) then this entire subsection can be disabled (you will also need to uncomment and update the **global.mongoUrl** with a connection string). But for the purposes of this document, we shall be deploying a Kubernetes hosted MongoDB instance so shall leave **enabled** set as true.

    ```yaml
   enabled: true
    ```

    Update the **rootPassword** to a unique and secure value from its
    current placeholder value.

    ```yaml
   rootPassword: reaction
    ```

    > Note: The Kubernetes hosted MongoDB instance should not be considered production ready and is only suitable for 
   > development or demonstration purposes.

## Configure Your Ingress Controller

As previously mentioned, this document assumes that an Ingress Controller is available on our Kubernetes environment. Depending upon the Ingress Controller being used it may be that additional ingress annotation values need adding to our **my_values.yaml** file. For example, if using the Nginx ingress controller then the following annotations will need adding under the **admin**, **API**, and **web** subsections.

```
kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
```

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  path: "/"
  annotations: {
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  }
```
Also, if using Nginx ensure that the following annotations are also added under the **admin** subsection.

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false",
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: "128k",
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffers-number: "4",
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: 3600,
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: 3600
```

## Configure SSL (Optional)

If you wish to prepare and configure SSL/TLS certificates for your deployment then these will need to be generated and signed by a trusted public Certificate Authority, ensuring that the FQDN values used above are included as the Subject or Subject Alternative Name within the certificate. These certificates will then need to be added to your Kubernetes cluster as a secret which can in turn be referenced within the **my_values.yaml** (under the admin, api and web subsections).

```yaml
tls:
  enabled: true
  secretName: tls-secret
```

This process is out of scope for this document though, consult your cloud providers documentation and the official Kubernetes documentation for further information. We shall not be configuring and using SSL for our deployment.

## Deploy Helm Chart

With our values file prepared we can now move on to the deployment of
our Open Commerce Helm chart.

1.  First, we need to download our chart dependencies.

    ```
    helm dependency update
    ```

2.  It is recommended to initially perform a "dry run" of our deployment to ensure there are no issues with our provided values or the chart itself. This can be done using the following command.

    ```
    helm install opencommerce . -f ./my_values.yaml --dry-run
    ```
3.  If no errors occur with the "dry run" deployment, then we are ready to perform the actual deployment.

    ```
    helm install opencommerce . -f ./my_values.yaml
    ```

4.  It will take several minutes for all the Kubernetes objects to deploy and initialise, particularly the MongoDB pods. The deployment process can be monitored.

    ```
    watch kubectl get pods -A
    ```

    When all the pods are "Running" and stable then the deployment is complete.

## Configure DNS

With our Open Commerce deployment completed we now need to create public DNS records, that match the configured FQDN's, so that the Admin, API and Web endpoints are publicly accessible.

We must first attain the public IP address of our Ingress objects load balancer; this can typically be done using the following command.

```
$ kubectl get service --A
```

You should see a **LoadBalancer** object that has an **EXTERNAL-IP** assigned. This address is the external IP of the clusters Ingress Controller.

You should create a public DNS record for each FQDN configured (Admin, API and Web) that uses the FQDN as the domain and the external IP as the target address.


## Configure Endpoints

Finally, with our Helm deployment complete and our external DNS records in place we can now test our Open Commerce endpoints are accessible using the FQDN's configured. If all is well then you should be able to access the Admin console, the example Storefront, and the API.

Note: As we did not utilise SSL certificates for our deployment it is likely that the Web Browser will complain when connecting to our URL's, this warning can be ignored as this is not an example of a production grade deployment.

## Use any Custom Open Commerce Container Images

If you have developed your own custom Open Commerce images (most likely for the API service) and you wish to deploy them via the Helm chart, then you would simply need to host them on a publicly accessible container registry (such as Docker Hub) and update the
**my_values.yaml** values to utilise the custom images tag and its repository.

```yaml
image:
  repository: reactioncommerce/reaction
  tag: 4.1.4
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # imagePullSecret
```

## Finishing Up

Although you now have a fully functional cloud hosted Open Commerce deployment it is important that this deployment is not considered production ready. To achieve production readiness much more configuration would be required, in terms of scaling, security, high availability, amongst other areas of concern.
