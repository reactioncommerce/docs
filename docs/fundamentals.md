## The basics

Mailchimp Open Commerce is an API-first, modular commerce stack. The API implements all features in GraphQL and is fully [extensible via plugins](/open-commerce/guides/build-api-plugin/).

Open Commerce is open-source-licensed, freely available software. You can explore the platform’s [repos on GitHub](https://github.com/reactioncommerce), or follow the [Quick Start guide](/open-commerce/guides/quick-start/) to install the development platform on your computer. If you’re interested in contributing to Open Commerce, be sure to read and follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/blob/trunk/public-docs/code-of-conduct.md/) and check out the [community resources](#community).

### Using Open Commerce

Whether you’re a business owner running a shop or a developer setting up a custom implementation, it’s easy to get a shop up and running with the Open Commerce development platform and build from there.

Every shop is built around a catalog of products. You can [set up your products](/open-commerce/docs/creating-organizing-products/) in the admin dashboard  and then [organize them with tags](/open-commerce/docs/tags-navigation/) to help shoppers navigate your catalog. Once shoppers have found what they want and make a purchase, you’ll [fulfill their orders](/open-commerce/docs/fulfilling-orders/) by accepting payments and delivering their items.

Developers can customize any part of the administrator or shopper experience by [writing plugins](/open-commerce/guides/build-api-plugin/). Because Open Commerce is fully modular, you’ll often want to [share code between plugins](/open-commerce/docs/sharing-code-between-plugins/) so features are available across the entire platform. If you’ve created a new plugin or modified an existing one and you want to share it with other developers, you can contribute to the [Open Commerce community](#community). When committing to existing Open Commerce repos, you should follow the [testing requirements](/open-commerce/docs/testing-requirements/)

### Open Commerce vs Reaction Commerce

Open Commerce was formerly known as Reaction Commerce. You may see references to Reaction throughout the guides and docs, especially in code—all Open Commerce repos are under the [`reactioncommerce`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce) GitHub organization. 

As we continue the renaming process, we’ll announce any future breaking changes in the [release notes](/release-notes/?filter=open-commerce).

## Development platform

The Open Commerce development platform is the simplest way to set up the API and its supporting services on your local machine. The development platform is containerized and uses public Docker images by default, though you can also choose to run the platform in development mode, which uses local images that can be updated on the fly as you make edits to a running plugin. 

The development platform has several `make` scripts that automatically pull the latest version of Open Commerce and start all of the required services using Docker Compose. The development platform runs on `localhost`; see the [Quick Start guide](/open-commerce/guides/quick-start/#clone-and-start-the-platform) for a list of ports where you can access its various services. For details on specific `make` commands for controlling and customizing the development platform, see the [development platform project documentation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-development-platform#project-commands) on GitHub.

## Plugins

All of Open Commerce’s features, including the [API core](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/api-core), are provided by first-party plugins—the [main project](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) is a shell that that imports all of the required NPM packages. This structure gives you complete control over what plugins and features are active in your installation. For more information on customizing these plugins or creating your own, check out the [Build an API Plugin guide](/open-commerce/guides/build-api-plugin/).

A wide range of first-party plugins covers all the basic platform features, including handling backend services, shop configuration, and the shopper experience. You can view a list of the plugins active in your instance in the admin dashboard under **Settings > System Information**. The plugins included with the development platform are:

## Environment variables

Much of the platform-wide configuration of Open Commerce is set via environment variables—either to pass information from one service to another or simply to customize the platform to meet your needs.

You can set variables in the `.env` file within each plugin, which is used by Docker Compose when starting the system and loading plugins. Each Open Commerce repo contains a `.env.example` file that lists the environment variables and default values for that project. You can run the `bin/setup` script within the project to automatically copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env` (although it will not overwrite existing values). Your `.env` files will contain personalized and potentially sensitive information, so you should never commit them to a public GitHub repo.

>**Note**: When running the development platform, its `make` scripts automatically set up the required `.env` files for you.

In some cases, projects may look for additional environment variables that are not listed in `.env.example` because they are optional and have default values set in the code. You can find these optional variables by searching for `cleanEnv` within a Node project.
